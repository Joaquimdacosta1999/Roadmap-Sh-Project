# 📝 Changelog Component – HTML & CSS Layout Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Changelog Component"** beginner-level layout challenge. It focuses on using **HTML and CSS** to build a responsive changelog section for a website, helping users stay informed about updates and improvements.

## 📖 Project Overview

A **changelog** is a record of notable changes made to a project or software. In this project, I created a simple, responsive changelog component using:

- Semantic HTML for structure  
- CSS for layout, spacing, and styling  
- Flexbox for responsive alignment and positioning

The goal was to practice layout fundamentals and build a component that can be easily integrated into any website.
