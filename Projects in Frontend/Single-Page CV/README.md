# ðŸ“„ Single-Page CV â€“ HTML Project

This project was built as part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) Frontend Developer path. The goal is to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. It focuses on semantic markup, SEO best practices, and preparing the page for future styling.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Build a single-page CV (Curriculum Vitae) using semantic HTML  
- Organize content into clear sections: Education, Skills, and Career History  
- Apply basic SEO principles using meta tags  
- Add Open Graph (OG) tags for improved social media sharing  
- Link a favicon to personalize the browser tab

This project does not include CSS styling yetâ€”itâ€™s focused entirely on structure and markup.
