# 🎯 Frontend Projects – roadmap.sh

This folder contains all the frontend development projects I’m building as part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) learning path. These projects range from beginner HTML layouts to advanced JavaScript applications and API integrations.

Each project is organized in its own subfolder with source code, assets, and documentation. As I progress through the roadmap, I’ll update this folder with completed projects, notes, and improvements.
