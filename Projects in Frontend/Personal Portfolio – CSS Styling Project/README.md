# ðŸ’¼ Personal Portfolio â€“ CSS Styling Project

This project was completed as part of the [roadmap.sh Portfolio Website Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website). It builds upon the previous HTML-only website by applying CSS styling to create a responsive and well-structured personal portfolio.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this project is to learn how to style a multi-page website using CSS. Starting from the semantic HTML structure built in the earlier project, I applied various CSS techniques to:

- Create responsive layouts for mobile and desktop  
- Apply consistent typography and spacing  
- Use color and layout to enhance visual hierarchy  
- Ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes

This project focuses on layout and responsiveness, not on final design aesthetics. The aim is to match the provided mockups and build a solid foundation for future visual enhancements.
